# 🤖 The Most Annoying Chatbot
**Where every word is a physical struggle.**

Welcome to the world's most inconvenient chat interface. This isn't just a chatbot; it's a test of patience. Powered by high-end AI and complex physics, it ensures that reading a simple reply takes 10x longer than it should.

## ❓ Why is it annoying?

* **Physics-Induced Lag:** Why read text instantly when you can watch it fall from the sky, bounce off the floor, and slowly "calibrate" itself for 5 seconds? (may take more)
* **Aggressively Efficient AI:** Powered by **Llama 3.3 70B**, the bot has a very limited space to give you a reply.
* **The Waiting Game:** You literally cannot type while the letters are moving. The UI locks you out because the physics are simply more important than your input.
* **Drama in Every Letter:** Using **PPO (Reinforcement Learning)**, each letter has its own brain, yet they still struggle to stand upright, often resulting in "kicking" and "shaking" just to form a readable sentence.

## 🛠️ Over-Engineered Tech Stack

We used an absurd amount of technology to make your life harder:
* **Physics:** Rapier2D (making sure letters never stay still).
* **AI:** Llama 3.3 70B via Groq (i'm not complaining, it's free).
* **Intelligence:** PPO Inference (so the letters can "try" their best).
* **Rendering:** Three.js (3D letters in a 2D world because why not?).

## 🕹️ How to Suffer (Usage)

1.  **Type** a polite message.
2.  **Watch** in frustration as the input disables itself.
3.  **Stare** at the "calibrating..." status while the letters do gymnastics.
4.  **Reset** the world when the chaos becomes too much.
